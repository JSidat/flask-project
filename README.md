## Introduction

The purpose of this project was to create a 'CRUD' application whilst utilising the tools tools, methodologies and technologies that were taught in the modules in this Enable DevOps course.


## Project Scope

The scope of the project outlines the minimum requirements to successfully complete the project and assesses our development against SFIA.
The minimum requirements for the project are outlined as follows:

* Project Tracking via a kanban style board such as trello that identifies the user story, use cases and progression of the project over a period of time.

* A relational database containing a minumum of two tables with some sort of relationship to store data generated in the application. 

* Documentation showing the structure of the project and as well as a risk assessment.

* A functional CRUD application developed in python following best practices.

* Fully comprehensive test suite with high test coverage of the back end with reports and evidence of testing results. Also needs to include automated validation testing for the application.
  
* A functioning front-end website that has full CRUD functionality.

* Use of github as the version control system using the feauture-branch model to fully integrate the code for the application.

## Technology constraints

The technology required to build the application were discussed during the training for this project and following technologies were to
be utilized to complete the project:

* Kanban style board(Trello board)
* GCP SQL database
* Programming language: Python
* Unit testing: Pytest
* Front-end: Flask(HTML)
* Version control: Git
* CI server: Jenkins
* Cloud server: GCP

## Project Management
 In this section I will be outlining the tools and methodologies used to keep on track with the project and cater for any changes that had to be made as the project progressed. Proper planning is imperative to make sure any unexpected occurences can be dealt with appropriately without negatively affecting the quality of the product.

### Agile methodologies
The agile methodology promotes thorough and constant communication ad breaking the project into several stages which arent dependant on each other in a linear fashion. This allows for flexibility when it comes to sudden changes to the project specification. The cycle of planning, executiing and evaluating that agile is based on, allows for top quality work to be produced in a timely manner.

Being a solo project some of the principles and methodologies had to be adapted to cater for the independent nature of the project:

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tool: this didnt apply to me as the project was a solo project. However we still conducted morning briefs and daily stand-ups to gain a good understanding of whatwas required on a daily basis.

* Working software over comprehensvie documentation: The purpose of the SFIA1 project is to test our porgramming skills and we were ultiamtely being tested on how well our applications worked and if they met the requirements set out in the project scope.

* Customer collaboration over contract negotiations: This part was not really applicable but I made the project with an intended end user in my mind, as shown through user stories.

* Responding to change over follwoing the plan: The direction my project went in was a slightly different to what I intended at the start but careful planning allowed me make these changes without affecting my overall performance.

### Kanban Board

A kanban style board was used to plan the project and layout my user stories and tasks. At the academy, we were introduced to the Trello board as a tool to plan the project, so this was the project planning tool that was used throughout the project.  

User stories are defined on the board. A product backlog based on these user stories is created from which tasks are created and completed with an ultimate objective of meeting the requirements set out in the user stories by adding all the relevant functionality and features. The board allows you to slide tasks form left to right as you start, progress and complete it and gives you a visual representation of your tasks and progress.

My definition of 'done' was the correct implementation of a feature or function where the feature ran without any bugs or issues and added the fucntionality that it was intended for.

#### Initial Kanban Board

For the intial Kanban board, a list was created that outlined the user stories for the project and the purpose for the productoin of the applcation. MoSCoW prioritisation was also used on the board. Anything marked with a red label was high priority and directly related to producing the minimum viable product, which in the grand scheme of things was the most important milestone to reach through the whole project. Marking these tasks allowed me focus on them and complete the minimum requirements for the project before moving onto other features and tasks.

#### Final Kanban Board

As the final Kanban board shows, the high priority jobs were completed which in turn meant the minimum requirements for the project were completed. The application had complete CRUD funtionality with a relational database to effectively store the relevant data from the application.
