The purpose of this project was to create a 'CRUD' application whilst utilising the tools tools, methodologies and technologies that 
were taught in the modules in this Enable DevOps course.


## Project Scope

The scope of the project outlines the minimum requirements to successfully complete the project and assesses our development against SFIA.
Thw minimum requirements for the project are outlined as follows:

* Project Tracking via a kanban style board such as trello that identifies the user story, use cases and progression of the project over a
period of time.

* A relational database containing a minumum of two tables with some sort of relationship to store data generated in the application. 

* Documentation showing the structure of the project and as well as a risk assessment.

* A functional CRUD application developed in python followign best practices.

* Fully comprehensive test suite with high test coverage of the back end with reports and evidence of testing results. Also needs to 
  include automated validation testing for the application.
  
* A functioning fornt-end website that has full CRUD functionality.

* Use of github as the version control system using the feauture-branch model to fully integrate the code for the application.
