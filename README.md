# QAC Fundamental Project


## Table of contents








## Introduction

The purpose of this project was to create a 'CRUD' application whilst utilising the tools tools, methodologies and technologies that 
were taught in the modules in this Enable DevOps course.


## Project Scope

The scope of the project outlines the minimum requirements to successfully complete the project and assesses our development against SFIA.
Thw minimum requirements for the project are outlined as follows:

* Project Tracking via a kanban style board such as trello that identifies the user story, use cases and progression of the project over a
period of time.

* A relational database containing a minumum of two tables with some sort of relationship to store data generated in the application. 

* Documentation showing the structure of the project and as well as a risk assessment.

* A functional CRUD application developed in python followign best practices.

* Fully comprehensive test suite with high test coverage of the back end with reports and evidence of testing results. Also needs to 
  include automated validation testing for the application.
  
* A functioning fornt-end website that has full CRUD functionality.

* Use of github as the version control system using the feauture-branch model to fully integrate the code for the application.

## Technology constraints

The technology required to build the application were discussed during the training for this project and following technologies were to
be utilized to complete the project:

* Kanban style board(Trello board)
* GCP SQL database
* Programming language: Python
* Unit testing: Pytest
* Integration testing: Selenium
* Front-end: Flask(HTML)
* Version control: Git
* CI server: Jenkins
* Cloud server: GCP

## Project Management
 In this section I will be outlining the tools and methodologies used to keep on track with the project and cater for any changes that had to be made as the project progressed. Proper planning is imperative to make sure any unexpected occurences can be dealt with appropriately without negatively affecting the quality of the product.

### Agile methodologies
The agile methodology promotes thorough and constant communication ad breaking the project into several stages which arent dependant on each other in a linear fashion. This allows for flexibility when it comes to sudden changes to the project specification. The cycle of planning, executiing and evaluating that agile is based on, allows for top quality work to be produced in a timely manner.

Being a solo project some of the principles and methodologies had to be adapted to cater for the independent nature of the project:

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tool: this didnt apply to me as the project was a solo project. However we still conducted morning briefs and daily stand-ups to gain a good understanding of whatwas required on a daily basis.
